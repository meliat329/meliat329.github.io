                <h4>Initial Sketches</h4>
                <p>
                    I began by sketching two different ideas for my children's coding exhibit. They each included different coding outputs and different ways of interacting
                    with the code. My goal was to create an interactive exhibit aimed at elementary aged children to be exposed to basic ideas of coding. I also wanted the exhibit
                    to be immersive and collaborative.

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Feedback</h4>
                <p>
                    I recieved feedback on how I could make the exhibit more collaborative, and how to integrate a story into it. 
                </p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>More Sketching</h4>
                <p>
                    I used the feedback I recieved to redesign my exhibit by creating a fairy-tale theme, and integrating a more concrete way to collaborate. 
                    The children would use the code they create to control characters in a fairy-tale band.

                <h4>Prototype One</h4>
                <p>
                    Since this class was during COVID-19 and I had limited resources to create a whole museum exhibit, I had to be creative when it came to prototyping.
                    I used stuffed animals, sticky notes, and some beat creation services to create a simple "Wizard of Oz" prototype, which I had my roommates casually test.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Final Prototype</h4>
                <p>
                    For my final prototype, I focused on the code blocks and how they would work together. We focused a lot on accesibility in the course so I wanted
                    my exhibit to be a tactile experience for those who are vision impaired, so I used raised symbols and puzzle-like code blocks. The prototype was still
                    a "Wizard of Oz" prototype, but I thought more about the system, and decided computer vision would be used to translate the code blocks to actual code that
                    controlled the fairy-tale band.
