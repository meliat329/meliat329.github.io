                    <h4>Needfinding</h4>
                    <p>
                        My group and I began by interviewing people interested in activities we knew next to nothing about to see if there were opportunity areas for 
                        an app. I interviewed someone who is a musical performance major and found that the classical music listening experience is not as good as it could be
                        as most music listening apps cater to popular music and use the song-album-artist method of categorization, which does not make sense with classical music.

                    <h4>Potential User Research</h4>
                    <p>
                        My group and I then interviewed people that would be potential users of the app. This included people who listen to classical music for enjoyment, people
                        who study classical music, and professors who use it to teach.This was to gain a better understanding of our problem area as none of us are too familiar
                        with classical music.

                    <h4>Competitor Research</h4>
                    <p>
                        We then researched our competitors such as Spotify, YouTube, and Idagio. None of these seemed to completely cover what classical music listeners need.

                    <h4>Design. Build. Test. Repeat.</h4>
                    <p>
                        We started with low fidelity prototyping on paper. We honed in on finding a good search method for classical music, and identified four main ways someone may want to
                        search for classical music: performer, composer, title, and conductor. We also figured users may want to combine these methods. We tested each of our prototypes and 
                        refined our design each time.

                    <h4>Final Prototype</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our final prototype was a wireframe on Figma that used simple buttons to select which way you would like to search. We have a separate playlist tab because
                        combining playlist with some of our search options would not make sense. Finally our name Legato was chosen because legato means to play
                        connected and smoothly, which is exactly how our app experience should be.
